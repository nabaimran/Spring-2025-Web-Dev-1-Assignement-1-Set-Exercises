      <h1>📖 Plot Summary – The Mentalist</h1>

    <h2>🔍 Overview</h2>
    <p><em>The Mentalist</em> centers on Patrick Jane, a former con-artist who posed as a psychic medium. After the brutal murder of his wife and daughter by the serial killer Red John, Jane abandons his fraudulent career and begins working with the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as a consultant. His sharp observational skills and mind games become valuable tools in solving complex crimes.</p>

    <h2>🧩 The Red John Arc</h2>
    <p>At the heart of the series lies Jane’s obsessive quest to identify and kill Red John. Over six seasons, clues, suspects, and copycats surface, building up to a dramatic and emotional confrontation that changes the course of the show forever.</p>

    <h2>👥 CBI & Team Dynamics</h2>
    <p>Jane works with a close-knit team led by Agent Teresa Lisbon. The team includes stoic Kimball Cho, affable Wayne Rigsby, and tech-savvy Grace Van Pelt. Together, they tackle homicides across California, often with Jane’s unorthodox — and brilliant — tactics.</p>

    <h2>✨ Character Evolution</h2>
    <p>While Jane begins the series emotionally closed-off and singularly focused on revenge, he gradually rebuilds trust and forms deep bonds with his teammates — especially Lisbon. Their relationship becomes a slow-burning thread that culminates in romantic development later in the series.</p>

    <h2>🕊️ Post-Red John</h2>
    <p>After Red John’s storyline concludes, Jane starts a new chapter with the FBI, continuing to solve crimes with Lisbon by his side. The final season wraps up with closure, healing, and a hopeful new beginning.</p>
